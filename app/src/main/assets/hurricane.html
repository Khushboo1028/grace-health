<ul style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-top:0cm;" type="disc">
  <li style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;">Stay informed about approaching storms by monitoring NOAA Weather radio or local television and radio stations for updates and evacuations.</li>
  <li style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;">Become familiar with your community's disaster preparedness plan and know your evacuation route. Select a common meeting place or single point-of-contact for all family members. If you have pets, have a plan for their evacuation as well.</li>
  <li style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;">Fill your gas tank and charge your cell phone so you're ready in case of evacuation. Be sure to bring your phone's charger with you.</li>
  <li style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;">Keep important documents, such as legal papers, birth certificates, marriage license, financial papers and insurance policy information, as well as valuables such as jewelry, in a safety deposit box or in a bolted safe in an interior closet in your home.</li>
  <li style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;">Maintain an emergency supply kit that will sustain you and your family for a 72-hour period. This kit should include flashlights, a portable radio, extra batteries, non-perishable food, bottled water, cash, blankets, clothing and toiletries. Replace and/or refresh items in your kit every six months.</li>
  <li style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;">Trim large trees and shrubs. Bring outside patio and lawn furniture, potted plants, and outdoor bicycles and toys indoors. Close and secure all awnings and tie down any loose items that may become projectiles in a high wind.</li>
  <li style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;">Make sure windows, doors and skylights are protected with appropriate shutters or impact-resistant glass. Plywood can be used as last-minute protection.</li>
  <li style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;">Regularly test your gas-powered generator and have plenty of fuel to ensure that it's ready when you need it.</li>
  <li style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;">If you are a collector, make a list of all works or objects in your collection.&nbsp;Include notes about any existing damage, as well as the condition of the frames and bases.</li>
  <li style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;">Secure all interior wall hangings and be sure that art hung on outside walls are taken off the wall and placed in an interior room, at least 3 inches off the floor.</li>
  <li style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;">Bring outdoor sculptures inside or secure outside in burlap or blankets tied with rope.</li>
  <li style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;">If you're located in a potential flood zone, move your car to higher ground or park it in your garage, carport or against the house to protect at least one side from flying debris. Do not park under trees, power lines or in low-lying areas.</li>
  <li style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;">For cars in your home garage, park them against the garage doors to keep them from buckling inward and potentially blowing them off the tracks.</li>
  <li style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;">Keep your family emergency kit as well as booster cables and tools, tire repair kit/spare tire, matches, flashlights, shovel and traction mats in your car.</li>
  <li style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;">Keep a copy of your homeowners insurance policy with you, in a waterproof container.</li>

<ul style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-top:0cm;" type="disc">
  <li style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;">Stay informed about approaching storms&nbsp;by monitoring NOAA Weather, local television and radio stations for severe weather updates.</li>
  <li style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;">Turn off utilities and evacuate if requested by authorities.</li>
  <li style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;">Identify a "shelter" room in your home. This enclosed area should be on the first floor, in the central part of the house with no windows. Avoid all unprotected windows and doors until the storm passes.</li>
  <li style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;">Appliances, including personal computers, should be unplugged and stored away in cabinets or interior closets.</li>
  <li style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;">Move appliances and household fixtures away from exterior doors and window openings.</li>
  <li style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;">Avoid driving on coastal or low-lying roads. If authorities allow vehicle traffic, use extreme caution when driving across water-covered roadways, especially if the water is moving.</li>
  <li style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;">Keep away from fallen power lines. If you are in an automobile that is hit by fallen wires, do not leave the vehicle. If you must leave the vehicle, jump out and off with both feet so you are completely clear of the vehicle before you touch the ground.</li>
</ul>
<h2 style="margin-right:0cm;margin-left:0cm;font-size:24px;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;,serif;">What to Do After a Hurricane or Windstorm</h2>
<ul style="margin-bottom:0cm;margin-top:0cm;" type="disc">
  <li style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;">Beware of loose or dangling power lines&nbsp;and report them immediately to the proper authorities.</li>
  <li style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;">Use your emergency supply of water&nbsp;or boil any water before drinking until official word is given that the water is safe.</li>
  <li style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;">Do not operate any generators or gas, propane or charcoal grills indoors&nbsp;or near your homeâ€™s ventilation areas.</li>
  <li style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;">If your home has sustained damage, take steps to prevent further damage by covering the roof with tarps and by covering windows with plywood if it is safe for you to do so.</li>
  <li style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;">If you have wet or damaged artwork, blot off excess moisture, remove wet backings, mats and frames and then keep them in an air-conditioned room. Contact a professional conservator for assistance as soon as possible.</li>
  <li style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;">Remove tarps and protective coverings on outdoor objects and rinse with clean water.</li>
  <li style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;">Dust items left indoors with a soft brush and wipe metal objects with a soft, lint-free cloth.</li>
  <li style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;">If you drive, be aware of fallen utility lines, debris on the roads and other hazards. Make sure you have a spare tire in case road debris results in a flat tire.</li>
  <li style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;">When driving, pay attention to any other post-storm changes, such as missing signs or broken traffic lights. Be cautious of any moving water before driving through it, as the current could carry your car away and possibly trap you inside.</li>
  <li style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;font-size:16px;font-family:&quot;Calibri&quot;,sans-serif;">Wash any debris from your car and take photos of any damage.</li>
